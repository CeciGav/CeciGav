- 👋 Hi, I’m @CeciGavia
- 👀 I’m looking for a job!
- 🌱 Currently I'm in formation as a Jr QA Testing Manual in CODERHOUSE and Udemy
I decided to make this jump due to my expusure to IT world in Luxoft, so, I'm fully
open to learn new technologies and become a QA Tester with the best practices :)) 
I enjoy working as a team and always share my knowledge with others 🤍
